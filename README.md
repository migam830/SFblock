# SFblock
SFblock is a block game made with C++ and SFML. I originally made this as my A-Level computer science project but I may still add new features from time to time.

To compile and run the project on Linux, install SFML with your package manager, clone this repository and run these commands:
```
  make
  ./sfblock
```

To see my project as it was when I finished my A-Level project, run the following command:
```
  git checkout alevel-final
```
